Automated Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning.

This project focuses on the development of an automated system to detect fake news using machine learning techniques. 
The objective is to build a model that can accurately classify news articles as real or fake based on their textual content.

Two machine learning algorithms were implemented and evaluated: XGBoost and Multinomial Naive Bayes. 
The dataset used for training and testing consisted of labeled news articles, enabling supervised learning.

Key Highlights:

Algorithms Used: XGBoost, Multinomial Naive Bayes
Preprocessing Techniques: Text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF vectorization

Performance Metrics:

Training Accuracy: 99%
Testing Accuracy: 95%

XGBoost demonstrated high predictive power, capturing complex patterns in the data, while Naive Bayes offered efficiency and strong baseline performance.
The model shows promising results for practical deployment in media verification systems or browser extensions to combat misinformation online.
